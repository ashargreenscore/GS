   - Or **A records** with Railway's IP addresses
5. Save changes
6. Wait 10-60 minutes for DNS propagation

---

### Step 7: Verify Deployment

After DNS propagates (check in Railway ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Domains):
- Visit: https://greenscore.world

  - Homepage: https://greenscore.world
  - Seller: https://greenscore.world/seller
  - Buyer: https://greenscore.world/buyer
  - Admin: https://greenscore.world/admin

## üîë Generated Session Secret

Your session secret has been generated and saved. Use it for the `SESSION_SECRET` environment variable in Railway.

## üìù Notes

- Railway automatically sets the `PORT` variable - don't add it manually
- Railway automatically provisions SSL certificates for your custom domain
- Database (greenscore.db) will be created automatically on first run
- File uploads will work, but consider Railway volumes for persistent storage

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**Git push fails?**

- Verify you're using the correct GitHub username: `ashargreenscore`

**Railway deployment fails?**
- Check the "Deployments" tab ‚Üí View logs
- Verify all environment variables are set correctly

**Domain not working?**
- Wait 30-60 minutes for DNS propagation
